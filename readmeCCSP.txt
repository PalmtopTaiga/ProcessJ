CCSP is the runtime for the C implementation of the compiler.

CCSP is a 32-bit library which among other things manipulates the program stack to
emulate process switching.

This means this library requires 32-bit versions of C libraries to compile.
Please verify you have the correct 32-bit libraries for your system.
